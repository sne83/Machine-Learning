# Some tips from experts:
* Even if we got good accuracy by using naive bayes type ML algorithms, still for better result use ensemble techniques. Stacking type algorithms.
* Use heuristic features also, these are basically hand-made features made by domain experts. If you have studied your data, you can also create your own features. It is not necessary to only depend on feature engineering. Combination of both performs well.
* Do not use deep learning directly, start with ML. Sometimes ML model performs greate than deep learning. To import and upload deep learning model on server is hectic.
* Make sure your data is not imbalanced. If data contains yes=80% & no=20%, from this imbalanced data we can't get better results. Use some techniques to balance that data.
* Solve more projects.
